**Providing presidential history**

I see that I need to answer the question: "Who was the first president of the United States?" Since the user asked in English, I’ll respond accordingly. There's no need for speculation here; it's a straightforward historical fact. The first president was George Washington, who served from 1789 to 1797 and is often called the "Father of His Country." I'll keep it concise and direct without using tools since it's a simple question. So, the answer is George Washington.

**Adding presidential context**

I can add a brief note about George Washington. He was the first U.S. president from 1789 to 1797 and set important norms, like limiting the presidency to two terms and establishing the cabinet. Although the user didn't explicitly ask for more details, adding this context feels helpful. So, I’ll present my answer as: George Washington served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797 and is often called the "Father of His Country." I'll keep it concise and straightforward.
